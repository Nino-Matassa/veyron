Covid 19 & Vaccine history representation by country. The app was designed to view the OWID 
designated status of any given country in terms of an historical overview and it's current vaccine status.

It's an experimental project designed to compliment Spirale, in a sense a place holder project
which will be converted to Kotlin at some stage so I can learn the stuff. Not sure if it's a 
great idea though.
